# Containers

# **Containers**

Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are **required when using our default grid system**. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers *can* be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint
- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint
- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100%` at all breakpoints
